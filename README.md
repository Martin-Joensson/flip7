## How to use the app?
Start a game by telling the app how many players there are. You can then rename the default player names if you want. You can also change player color and if you want the text to be dark or light. 

Add all scores as they get tallied in the game and click submit to score the round. It will take you to the next round.

In the settings you can change the score needed to win and if you want to display the individual rounds. It's of by default to facilitate inputing the scores.
