# Flip 7 Score App

### Made because Flip 7 is awesome, but keeping scores in you head aren't.

## Where can I find it live?
Here: soooon.

## How to use the app?
Start a game by telling the app how many players there are. You can then rename the default player names if you want. 

Add all scores as they get tallied in the game and click submit to score the round. It will take you to the next round.

In case a mistake is made you can edit old submited scores.
